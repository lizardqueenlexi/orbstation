  Ghommie:
  - bugfix: Fish will no longer drown if left half-submerged in a fishable turf on
      which it can normally be found. Instead it will disperse after a while or if
      starving. Note that this only happens if the fish is native to such turfs (eg.
      lavaloop on beach water will still die).
  SmArtKar:
  - bugfix: Fixed gas station and phonebooth ruins magically summoning weather on
      bottom levels of Icebox
2025-04-02:
  TiviPlus:
  - refactor: "Logging and IC timestamps will now always use UTC\xB10 and not be affected\
      \ by server system timezone changes"
  - bugfix: "Station and round times will not longer be incorrect if the system timezone\
      \ is not UTC\xB10"
  Y0SH1M4S73R:
  - code_imp: Any tgui message that would be too big to send to the server is now
      split into chunks and sent in sequence. This fixes several issues, such as...
  - bugfix: It is once again possible to save large amounts of text on paper at once.
  jlsnow301:
  - bugfix: Fixed the circuit UI titlebar spacing
  - bugfix: The library console has been refactored. Report any issues in the github!
  timothymtorres:
  - map: Move mafia, CTF, and deathmatch maps into minigame folder
2025-04-03:
  Absolucy:
  - refactor: Refactored some code related to initialization.
  - code_imp: Runtime errors will now print to the chat while debugging.
  Melbert:
  - refactor: Minor mining voucher refactor, report any oddities.
  - qol: All spell invocations have been made a bit more consistent - some have changed
      slightly, some are now punctuated. "Dragon Form" and "Bear Form" are now emotes
      invocations.
  - qol: '"Unknown" mobs are now properly referred to as they/them'
  - qol: Burning paper (and similar) is now two way. Rather than needing to click
      on the paper with a burning item, you can now click on a burning item with the
      paper. This means you can burn paper on your lit cigarette like a badass.
  - qol: You can now light cigarettes on candles.
  - rscdel: Flares and candles can no longer craft into flashlight eyes, I guess.
2025-04-04:
  Jacquerel:

  Singul0:
  - rscadd: You can now flip tables by right clicking them!
  SmArtKar:
  - balance: Restaurant portals can now be printed, constructed and deconstructed.
      They're also no longer completely invulnerable.
  Watermelon914:
  - refactor: Refactored subsystem initialization
  necromanceranne:
  - bugfix: Attempts were made to make chemical interactions with regards to splashes
      or exposure to chemicals on your skin respect clothing cover. If you have clothing
      with biological protecting properties, chemicals may not affect you as easily.
      Good for you.
  - balance: Some chems may behave differently than they originally did in light of
      utilizing suit protections appropriately. Make sure if you want someone to be
      exposed to the full effect of a chemical that they're not wearing anything in
      the way before splashing them.
2025-04-05:
  Gaxeer:
  - bugfix: '`round_time` in stat panel and ESC menu will show actual time since the
      round start, not the world time'

      it being hidden at the very bottom.
  - bugfix: Fixed some edge cases where player worn icons wouldn't update properly...
      such as blades being hidden when equipping to a void cloak.
  - code_imp: Optimized a proc related to getting a specific player's mob FAR less
      inefficient.
  ArcaneMusic:
  - rscadd: New Medical bounty! Scan crewmates who have been healed or currently have
      a clean bill of health, and ship the medical report to prove that you're not
      accidently letting them die on your watch. Most of the time.
  - balance: Assistant bounties for toolboxes now only require 1, but the toolbox
      must be fully stocked like standard mechanical toolboxes.

      3 plants now, however.
  - balance: The action figure bounty now only requires toys instead.
  - rscdel: Removed the pens bounty.
  - balance: The robotics mech bounty now requires a diagnostic scan of a newly completed
      mech as opposed to sending the whole mech itself. Diagnostic scans can now be
      generated by riding in a mech and completing the action from the UI menu. Mech
      bounties are worth about half as much.
  - rscadd: Mechs can be sold on the cargo shuttle for the remaining half of the value
      from previous mech bounties.
  - bugfix: You can now no longer roll duplicates of the same bounties when generating
      a new bounty from the civilian bounty console.
  Bombermansam:
  - rscadd: Makes Nuggetboxes small items so they can fit inside paper sacks.
  Ezel:
  - map: Switched some things around in wawastation cargo
