This is the codebase for the Orbstation fork of the tgstation build of SpaceStation 13.

Orbstation is focused around removing the more unpleasant/bigoted flavor of tgstation, improving support/balancing for small servers, and adding fun mechanics and additions that would likely not be approved upstream.

## How to play

Orbstation is primarily run on a single, private BYOND server. Instructions for joining and announcements of upcoming sessions are posted on the Orbstation Discord server, which is currently invite-only.

## How to contribute

1. Make a **fork** of the `orbstation/orbstation` branch under your own github account to keep your changes in.

    * If you plan on working on multiple discrete changes at once (say, adding a new item, rebalancing a weapon, and modifying some flavor text), make a separate **branch** on your fork for each separate change — this makes it easier to make separate pull requests later on.

2. **Download** your fork to your computer using your Git manager of choice. For those new to Git, [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) is free and easy to use.

3. **Make your changes** using an IDE of your choice.

    * [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [BYOND support extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ss13.byond) is highly recommended, as it features code completion and a shortcut (f5) to compile, run, and connect to a server. No more messing around with DreamDaemon!

    * If possible (usually when adding new features instead of removing or modifying existing ones), place modifications in the **Orbstation folder**. This keeps features unique to Orbstation organized and helps to prevent future merge conflicts.

4. Submit a **pull request** from your local fork or branch to the `orbstation/orbstation` branch. 

Please note that `orbstation/master` is a copy of the `tgstation/master` branch from upstream, and is used primarily to help with merging things from upstream to Orbstation. If you want to submit a change to the upstream Tgstation repo, send a pull request to `tgstation/master`, not `orbstation/master`.

This is the codebase for the /tg/station flavoured fork of SpaceStation 13.

Space Station 13 is a paranoia-laden round-based roleplaying game set against the backdrop of a nonsensical, metal death trap masquerading as a space station, with charming spritework designed to represent the sci-fi setting and its dangerous undertones. Have fun, and survive!

## DOWNLOADING
[Downloading](.github/guides/DOWNLOADING.md)

[Running a server](.github/guides/RUNNING_A_SERVER.md)

[Maps and Away Missions](.github/guides/MAPS_AND_AWAY_MISSIONS.md)

## Compilation

**The quick way**. Find `bin/server.cmd` in this folder and double click it to automatically build and host the server on port 1337.

**The long way**. Find `bin/build.cmd` in this folder, and double click it to initiate the build. It consists of multiple steps and might take around 1-5 minutes to compile. If it closes, it means it has finished its job. You can then [setup the server](.github/guides/RUNNING_A_SERVER.md) normally by opening `tgstation.dmb` in DreamDaemon.

**Building tgstation in DreamMaker directly is deprecated and might produce errors**, such as `'tgui.bundle.js': cannot find file`.
