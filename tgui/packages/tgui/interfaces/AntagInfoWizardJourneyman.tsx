                  Your magical diploma will remind you what spells you majored
                  in during your studies. You get four choices from three
                  categories, each of which will present you with four options.
                  <br />
                  <span style={destructionstyle}>
                    The first category will present you with spells or artifacts
                    you can use to obliterate your enemies or their space
                    station.
                  </span>
                  <br />
                  <span style={defensestyle}>
                    The second category will present you with spells or
                    artifacts you can use to keep yourself safe and alive,
                    always important.
                  </span>

                  <span style={summonstyle}>
                    The final category contains spells and artifacts of less
                    straightforward utility, though they are no less valuable.

                  As you have not yet reached the spellcasting heights of your
                  elders, you will often need to make use of magical tools and
                  staves. Remember that in many cases any non-magical fool can
                  utilise these, and they will eagerly take them from you given
                  the chance!
